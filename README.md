# Exercise 

Create an application that will prompt for a user to input a string. Using the user’s inputted string, find the first letter that is not repeated. 
 
For example: If given the string ‘Bubble’, the letter ‘u’ would be the first character returned from the program. Once the first character is found and displayed back to the user, rewrite the string in order of number of occurrences and order from the inputted string. In the above example ‘Bubble’ would then be rewritten as ‘uleBbb’. Display this to the user.

# How to run the code

Paste script contents into console (content in between <script> </script>)
Run code (cmd + enter)

# Final Questions

**A) How long did this assessment take you in minutes? (Example: 45 minutes)**

48 minutes 54 seconds. This is without the time to setup github/html file and purely just coding in javascript. 

**B) Available start date?**

As soon as needed. I am actively interviewing with 3 other companies. The companies I'm interviewing for are in New York, Los Angeles, Seattle.

**C) Are you available to work from our office in Orem Utah permanently within the next 3 weeks?**

Yes, I'm willing to relocate and work from the office if the opportunity is right for me. I value growth and learning above all else.

**D) Additional comments**

The example and instructions were unclear on how to handle uppercase characters. B occurs once but is grouped in with the lowercased bs in the rewritten string. I assumed that uppercase characters took precedence over lowercased characters like in a normal sorted order. 

However, it could've easily been assumed that since B is before any b in the original input string, that this is the reason it comes before any other bs.

For example, BubBle => uleBbB. The order of b's are 'BbB' in this scenario.

I had to make a decision for the sake of speed so I went with the former route.
